#In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to qualify statistcs about customer order and data

-- 1. How many orders were placed in Janurary?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';


-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product= 'iPhone';

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'OrderIF';

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
-- I am using SQL here to demonstrate multiple ways to answer the above question. 

SELECT MIN(price), Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product,price
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

SELECT product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

-- 6. Which prodcuts were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 

SELECT SUM(Quantity), product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT (distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'Order ID';

-- 8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. 

SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;


--------------- In the section below, I used SQL to answer more advanced questions pertaining to the available data. 


-- 1. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they receive?


SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2


-- 2. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT sum(Quantity) as quantity,
Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product

-- 3. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id

WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

-- # OR # 

SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id

WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


-- 4. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 

select sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id

WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


-- 5. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product, 
sum(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc 
LIMIT 1

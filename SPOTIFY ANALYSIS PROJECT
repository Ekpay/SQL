-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Lastly, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

-- I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

-- Next, I analyzed the data using the following SQL.


SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;


--- 1. Who are the top 3 artists with the longest duration time?

SELECT distinct artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY duration_ms
LIMIT 3 

-- 2. What is the average tempo for each artist?

SELECT DISTINCT AVG(tempo), artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name

-- 3. Who are the top 5 most popular artists?

SELECT distinct artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5;


-- 4. 

-- I am using SQL to calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
-- For every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, I show their name, average popularity, and label them as a "Top Star"
-- I will provide the answer by demonstrating the use of CTE within my SQL query.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s
GROUP BY s.artist_name)


SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
